## Project Overview:

Zomato, the popular restaurant aggregator and food delivery company, organizes its data using four primary tables: sales, users, product, and goldusers_signup. Let's dive into each table:

1. **Sales Table**: This table keeps track of all the purchases made by customers on Zomato. It stores information such as user IDs, order dates, and product IDs.

2. **Users Table**: Here, Zomato stores information about its customers such as User IDs and signup dates.

3. **Product Table**: Zomato has a list of all the food and drinks available from its partner restaurants. This table includes product IDs, names, and prices.

4. **Goldusers_signup Table**: Zomato offers a premium subscription service called Zomato Gold. This table keeps track of users who signed up for it and membership start dates.

Using these tables, I have developed SQL queries to gain insights into Zomato's operations and customer interactions.
